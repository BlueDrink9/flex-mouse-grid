# Dense Mouse Grid

A hands-free mouse grid by Tara Roys, timotimo, and aegis.

This script depends on having support from a phonetic alphabet and numbers scritps.  It is designed to be used along with the knausj-talon repository, but is compatable with any repository that provides the letters a-z using the <user.letters> capture and the <numbers> caputre.

The Alphabet Soup mouse is a completely hands-free replacement for traditional mousing. It replaces mouse movements with voice commands.  You tell the computer what grid coordinate you want to move to on the screen, and the mouse grid moves your cursor to that location

To open the dense mouse grid, say 

  alphabet soup

To close the dense mouse grid, say

  alphabet close

To use the mouse grid, say a number and two letters from whichever Talon phonetic alphabet you are using.  For example, if you are using the default Talon phonetic alphabet that comes with the knausj-talon repository, to go grid location grid square 1, row B, colum C, you would say 

  One Bat Cap
