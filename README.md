# Dense Mouse Grid

[video demonstration here](https://youtu.be/paWx7bF_IH8 )

The Dense Mouse Grid is a voice operated mousing system relying on naming all points on a screen with a number-letter-letter coordinate, so I can say '3 A B' and it will move the mouse to sector 3, row a, column b on the screen. 

The README for this project is provided in [the dense mouse grid folder](dense_mouse_grid/README.md) because it is useful to keep the script and the documentation all together in the same folder when installing Talon plugins.
