# Dense Mouse Grid

A hands-free mouse grid by Tara Roys, timotimo, and aegis.


The Alphabet Soup mouse is a completely hands-free replacement for traditional mousing. It replaces mouse movements with voice commands.  You tell the computer what grid coordinate you want to move to on the screen, and the mouse grid moves your cursor to that location.

Use 'alphabet soup' to open the dense mouse grid and 'alphabet close' to close it.

To use the mouse grid, say a number and two letters from whichever Talon phonetic alphabet you are using.  For example, if you are using the knausj-talon deposit repository, the  command would be "One Bat Cap" to go to grid location 1BC

The Mouse Grid has 3 modes: frame mode, the default, a checkerboard mode, and a full mode.  Each pattern has advantages and disadvantages.

To scale up or scale down the whole grid, say the command "bigger bowl" and "smaller bowl."

To change the background transparency, use the commands "Thicker broth" and "thinner broth"
