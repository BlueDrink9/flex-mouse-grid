# Dense Mouse Grid

A hands-free mouse grid by Tara Roys, timotimo, and aegis.

This script depends on having support from a phonetic alphabet and numbers scritps.  It is designed to be used along with the knausj-talon repository, but is compatable with any repository that provides the letters a-z using the <user.letters> capture and the <numbers> caputre.

The Alphabet Soup mouse is a completely hands-free replacement for traditional mousing. It replaces mouse movements with voice commands.  You tell the computer what grid coordinate you want to move to on the screen, and the mouse grid moves your cursor to that location

To **open the dense mouse grid,** say 

    alphabet soup

To **close the dense mouse grid**, say

    alphabet close

To **use the mouse grid, say a number and two letters from whichever Talon phonetic alphabet you are using.**  For example, if you are using the default Talon phonetic alphabet that comes with the knausj-talon repository, to go grid location grid square 1, row B, colum C, you would say 

    One Bat Cap 
    
You can say each coordinate slowly, as individual commands, and each time you say a command the grid will give a visual indicator of what you have chosen.  As you get more proficient, you can say the command quickly and the grid will teleport the mouse to that coordinate.

The Mouse Grid has 3 visual modes to help remind you spot locations on the screen: 
       * **frame mode**, the default, which puts a frame of letters around every large number block and leaves most of the screen clear,  
       * **checkerboard mode**, which puts an alternating checkerboard pattern of letters across the scren
       * **full mode**.  which puts letters on every possible coordinate. 

Each pattern has advantages and disadvantages. Full mode displays every possible coordinate.  The coordinates made visible in full mode are there in every mode.  Checkerboard mode and frame mode simply hide a lot of the labels so that it is easier to see what you are trying to point at.  
  
To activate checkers, say

    alphabet checkers
 
To activate full, say 
  
    alphabet full
  
The mouse grid comes set to frame mode by default.  To activate frame mode, say 
   
    alphabet frame

To **scale up the whole grid**, say the command 
  
    bigger bowl
  
To **scale it down,** say 
    
    smaller bowl.

 To **make the background more transparent**, say 
  
      thinner broth
  
 To **make the background less transparent**, say 
     
      thicker broth

 To **make the letter labels more transparent**, say 
   
    eat noodles

 To **make the letters less transparent**, say 
  
    add noodles
